# P2P_default_risk
This repository is for the applicant's credit default prediction, the data set is from LendingClub.

The goal of this program is trying to build a machine learning model,
which can classify the hight default risk applicate and low default risk applicate
on the P2P lending platform. 

## 3 different project
1. Basic classification ( wiht data imbalance)
2. Clustering add classification
3. Regression of loss money

### Basic classification
 In this project, we applied Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine(SVM), C5.0, and RandomForest as classifer.
 the file have 3 steps, data preprocessing, data imbalance, and classifer training.

### Clustering add classification
 In this project, we add K-mean to improve basic classification,
 the file add one steps about clustering.

### Regression of loss money
 In this project, we change the lable, we pressent the risk by how much is the applicant failed to payback.
 the file add different data preprocessing part.
